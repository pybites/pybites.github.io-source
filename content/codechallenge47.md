<a name="top"></a>Hi Pythonistas, can you believe [itâ€™s been a full year of PyBites](https://pybit.es/special-birthday-new-platform.html) already?! To commemorate our 1st birthday we figured the next challenge should be aroundâ€¦ us!

## The Challenge

The challenge is open in that youâ€™re welcome to use whatever floats your boat. The requirement however, is that you analyse Olumpic Medals data!

1. Data gathering

	Weâ€™ve compiled some ideas for you:

	- Analyse our blog posts with a data point of your choice. Most common blog post tag or category? With 239 posts ([*1](#numposts)) there should be quite some data to consume (you can [clone the repo](https://github.com/pybites/pybites.github.io), donâ€™t make repeated requests)

	- Hit up our [Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/pybites) and look for our most popular tweets / hashtags. Spot any more obvious trends or themes? 
	Look at our [Github Repos](https://github.com/pybites/) and see what data you can collect and represent. Commit times? Commit totals? Growth rate of the blog in words committed per month? Popular Repos? Or do an analysis per repo:

		- [Challenges repo](https://github.com/pybites/challenges): who PRs the most, what challenge has the most PRs?

		- [100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/pybites/100DaysOfCode) - another repo with a lot of data / code in it.

	- These are the main sources that come to mind. If you have other ideas, share them in the comments below. 

2. Data visualization

	Once you have your data, weâ€™d love it if you tested your data visualisation skills and creativity to show off the dataset! Pandas, Matplotlib, Bokeh, Seaborn, use what you are most comfortable with or what you want to learn.

	Ideally you deliver more than one graph. Be creative, you not only delight us, our growing community loves this stuff too, so they are probably on the watch out for cool PRs ðŸ¤“


## The Rewards

It wouldnâ€™t be a birthday without gifts right? Our three favourite PRs for this challenge will win a prize!

- Most original / die hard solution: A hardcopy of [one of our favorite Python books](https://pybit.es/python-resources.html): [Effective Python: 59 Specific Ways to Write Better Python](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0134034287/?tag=pyb0f-20)

- 10 USD towards your favorite beverage. Thatâ€™s right, the winner of this price sends us his or her email and we deposit 10 bucks which should go towards a wine, beer or coffee, or if thatâ€™s not your thing, well â€¦ towards a Python related goal. 

- Best submissions 3, 4 and 5 get a (limited edition) set of PyBites stickers (bear with us though, they are still *in dev* ...)

Submission deadline: <strike>6th of January 2018 05:00:00 CET__ (happy birthday Julian!)</strike> - UPDATE: holidays are busy, and starting the New Year ... let's extend this to the 16th of Jan 00:00:00 [AoE](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe) - have fun!

## Logistics 

### Getting Ready

As [you might have seen](https://twitter.com/pybites/status/943811489537945600) we launched our [Code Challenges Platform](https://codechalleng.es/). We encourage you to make it your default workflow for our challenges. 
It should save you time and standardize the process. 

And you can enjoy our new line weâ€™re starting: *Bites of Py*: work on small code exercises in the comfort of your browser. We are thrilled how this is coming along so please use it and let us know what you think ...

### PR (Pull Request) to Get Credit

*PR or it did not happen* - but seriously why? Check our __Grow by PR__ section on our [1 Year article](https://pybit.es/special-birthday-new-platform.html). Basically it makes you a more valuable developer. 

Make sure you PR your work providing some feedback where requested! We will make sure to include original ones in our [monthly review post](https://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html). For *original* we weigh both the code as well as the info provided in the PR.

### PyBites Slack

You like these challenges? We have published [quite a few](https://github.com/pybites/challenges) and we're not planning to stop anytime soon!

You *really* like our challenges and plan to submit PRs? Youâ€™d like to share ideas with other Pythonistas? Consider joining our growing community on Slack. It becomes an opt-in when you confirm your email [on our platform](https://codechalleng.es/).

## About

Our goal is to learn and teach you Python through practical exercises. Learning a programming language is way more fun as a community!

For any feedback, issues or ideas use [GH Issues](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues), [tweet us](https://twitter.com/pybites) or [drop us an email](mailto:pybitesblog@gmail.com).
