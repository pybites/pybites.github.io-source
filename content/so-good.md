Summary: If there is one career book we could recommend you it's "So Good They Can't Ignore You". In this article some of the main takeaways for me.

For me the most succinct career advice [comes from Steve Martin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teAvv6jnuXY):

> Be So Good They Can't Ignore You.

Which became the title of one of [my favorite career books by Cal Newport](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1455509124/?tag=pyb0f-20).

In his book Cal demonstrates that following your passion is generally bad advice.

Skills trump passion. 

Yes I love programming now, but it was not love at first sight per se. 

Sure, I had a knack for automating things. 

Yes, I got (still get) excited by hacker scenes of movies like Swordfish and Antitrust ;)

But the journey to learn to code is also filled with frustration before it gets any fun.

So one of the main takeaways from "So Good They Can't Ignore You" is that you need to be strategic in your skill choice.

These days you almost cannot go wrong learning Python.

If you 100% focused on coding though, you are missing out on a lot of other [soft skills](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bbelderbos_softskills-leadershipgoals-negotiation-activity-6661864706698956800-_Dey) that are equally if not more important.

It all goes back to adding value. As Zig Ziglar said:

> You will get all you want in life, if you help enough other people get what they want.

[Cal's book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1455509124/?tag=pyb0f-20) will inspire you. It will challenge you to take action. 

Once you start developing what he calls a "craftsman mindset" and start building up "career capital" there is no return.

But there is no shortcut here. And you have to be patient. It will take years of constant (and strategic) effort and focus.

Showing up and working hard will only get you that far. It's not only the amount of work (e.g. [the 10,000-Hour Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book))), it's also about what you do in that time, your (unique) approach. 

It often requires you to become uncomfortable. Deliberate practice isn't always fun [as Pythonistas on our platform can attest](https://codechalleng.es/testimonials), but you come out stronger, better prepared.

To speak in fitness terms: muscles grow under stress. And so does your career if you constantly look for new opportunities, going beyond what you already know (and is comfortable), learning new things, exploring adjacent fields of expertise.
