Summary: If there is one career book we could recommend you it's "So Good They Can't Ignore You". In this article some of the main takeaways for me.

For me one of the most succinct pieces of career advice [comes from Steve Martin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teAvv6jnuXY):

> Be So Good They Can't Ignore You.

Which is also the title of one of [my favorite career books by Cal Newport](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1455509124/?tag=pyb0f-20).

In his book Cal demonstrates that following your passion is generally bad advice. Skills trump passion!

Yes I love programming now, but it was not love at first sight per se. 

I did have a knack for automating things (using Excel) but that alone did not make me marketable.

Yes, I got excited by hacker scenes of movies like Swordfish and Antitrust, but real programmer life is of course nothing like that ;)

Actually the journey to learn to code is filled with doubt and frustrating moments. Only after you grasp the fundamentals does it become any fun.

So one of the main takeaways from "So Good They Can't Ignore You" is that passion does not precede skills, and it's the strategic  focus on the latter that will determine how succesful you will be.

These days you almost cannot go wrong learning Python. But it's never the tech skills alone that will get you there.

If you 100% focused on coding, you are missing out on a lot of other [important soft skills](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bbelderbos_softskills-leadershipgoals-negotiation-activity-6661864706698956800-_Dey).

> You will get all you want in life, if you help enough other people get what they want.

[Cal's book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1455509124/?tag=pyb0f-20) will inspire you. It will challenge you to take action. 

Once you start developing what he calls a "craftsman mindset" and start building up "career capital" there is no return.

But there is no shortcut here. And you have to be patient. It will take years of constant (and strategic) effort and focus.

Showing up and working hard will only get you that far. It's not only the amount of work (e.g. [the 10,000-Hour Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book))), it's also about what you do in that time, your (unique) approach. 

It often requires you to become uncomfortable. Deliberate practice isn't always fun [as Pythonistas on our platform can attest](https://codechalleng.es/testimonials), but you come out stronger, better prepared.

To speak in fitness terms: muscles grow under stress. And so does your career if you constantly look for new opportunities, going beyond what you already know (and is comfortable), learning new things, exploring adjacent fields of expertise.
