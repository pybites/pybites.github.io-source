How are you progressing with your Python? What could be holding you back?

I gave it some thought and identified 4 issues we commonly see that hold people back from becoming a proficient Pythonista and programmer.

## 1. Tutorial paralysis

This by far the pitfall we hear about the most: having to read 4+ books in order to start writing code. Wrong. These resources are most effective if you alternate them with writing code. So the sooner you write code and FAIL the better.

## 2. Improper sequencing

Taking too many steps at the same time.

I literally saw somebody in a group asking: "I need a learning path for ML. I don't know programming yet". My reply was: "Try to crawl then walk then run. Start with the basics of Python / programming first."

The same is true with other parts of your programming journey:

- Yes it's important to write thorough test code, but don't obsess over pytest features (yet), simply assert your function outputs for starters.

- Yes it's important to know data and web (where Python is used a lot), but learning a web framework without knowing at least the basics of classes, databases, some html/css, you set yourself up for a rough ride.

- Yes it's important to write clean and fast code, yet in your first iteration you should really focus on getting something to work first (sad realization: how many great apps were never written because their creators were stalled by perfectionism?).

- Yes you might be asked about binary search in a coding interview, but if you distill it down all complex problems are made up of simpler subproblems. So focus on the basic data structures/ concepts first: list vs dict, mutable vs immutable, etc. They form the fundamental building blocks of your programs. 

We estimate that with ~20 well selected Bite exercises [on our platform](http://codechalleng.es/bites) you will get further than banging your head against the wall trying to absorb a coding interview book (see 1.)

## 3. Obsessing over Pythonic code

As important it is to know to effectively use Python constructs and writing _Pythonic_ code, you should equally invest in learning about software best practices:

- Use meaningful names

- Use proper scoping / modular code

- Write short and testable functions / methods

You can write very Pythonic code but if your functions are > 100 LOC and have a lot of [cyclomatic complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity), you won't be (perceived as) an effective programmer.

Aim to read a software book each month and spend at least 1 hour a week reading [top quality open source projects](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-open-source-projects/) like requests, Flask, Django or OpenCV.

[Awesome Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) provides a curated list of awesome Python frameworks, libraries, software and resources. This is a great starting place and with the [Github mobile app](https://github.com/mobile) it's even easier now :)

## 4. Going on your own for too long

My first Python code I wrote as a support engineer among fellow support engineers. 

I became the tool developer expert, the _go-to guy_. It felt great but cheerleaders are bad for growth. And ego is bad for growth. So I took an honest look:

- I was not exposed to a large professional code base.

- I did not use any advanced Python tooling.

- I was not surrounded by Python developers that were doing this for many many years.

As we always say at PyBites: _if you're comfortable for too long, alarm bells should go off_.

Remember: success leaves clues! Merely by surrounding yourself by experts you will inevitably grow (it's like gravity).

So we challenge you: become a small fish in a big pond again and your future self will thank you.

I hope this is helpful. Comment below if you see any other common mistakes people make when learning Python / programming.

Keep Calm and Code in Python!
