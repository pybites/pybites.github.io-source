## Use the PyBites Platform in the Classroom

As a technology teacher, you know the benefits of teaching kids to code.

Not only is it a necessary skill in today's tech driven industries but it inspires creativity!

[PyBites Platform](http://codechalleng.es/) is an online Python coding platform that allows students from Grade 6 and up to learn Python by challenging themselves with our coding exercises.

_Learning by doing_ is one of the best ways for people to learn and retain a skill.

Having 2 kids each of our own, we stand by this methodology and encourage our kids to learn this way as often as possible. This is why we do what we do. This is why we know our PyBites exercises are the perfect challenge for students around the world.

The platform isn't just developed with the students in mind though.

Having many teacher friends and contacts, we know how difficult and stressful it is to be a teacher - especially with this current, global shift to home schooling. Being able to monitor your students' progress is key so we have reporting mechanisms in place that have been tested and approved by Python school teachers.

Exercises being self-paced will allow you to point your students to specific exercises then step away to focus on your own work while they're busy coding away. You even have the added benefit of designing your own exercises for them to solve.

Listen here how a school in Florida uses our platform with great success:

There's so much more to the [PyBites Platform](http://codechalleng.es/) and we'd love nothing more than to speak with you to discuss how you can implement it in your school and teach your students Python.
