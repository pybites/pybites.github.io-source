  <p>Get ready for some Python career changing advice. People have gained great clarity in our sessions.</p>

  <p>Note that we're taking 45 min out of our busy schedules to talk with you and we're fully committed to providing you with a ton of insight and value. The only thing we ask is that you honor the commitment you've made and join the call at the meeting time. We don't reschedule these calls.</p>

  <p>We look forward talking to you soon.</p>
